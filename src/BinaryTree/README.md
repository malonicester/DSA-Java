### Binary Tree

- Complete Binary Tree
    - All Level full
    - Except the last level which is filled from left to right
- Full or Complete Binary Tree Or Strict Binary Tree
    - Every node has either 0 or 2 children
- Perfect Binary Tree
    - All levels are filled

#### Properties
 - The total number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height h is 2^(h+1) - 1
 - Perfect binary has maximum number of node as all the levels are filled.
 - The total number of leaf node in a perfect binary tree is 2^h

### Binary Search Tree
- Difference of height between any two children on the same level is less than or equal to 1.
- Hence it is a balanced tree.
